Choose one that is compatible with the remote computer's operating system.\n\n4. **Run the Script or Program:**\n   - Run the script or program on the remote computer to start playing the videos in your playlist.\n   - Set the script or program to loop the playlist continuously for 24 hours or until you have reached your desired watch time.\n\n5. **Monitor the Progress:**\n   - Periodically check the YouTube Analytics dashboard to monitor your watch time progress.\n   - Make adjustments to the script or program if necessary to ensure that the videos are playing smoothly and continuously.\n\nRemember that using RDP to artificially inflate your watch time may violate YouTube's terms of service. It's always best to focus on creating engaging and high-quality content that will naturally attract viewers and increase your watch time."}]},{"role":"user","parts":[{"text":"How to create free RDP"}]},{"role":"model","parts":[{"text":"To create a free RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose a Free RDP Software:**\n   - There are several free and open-source RDP software available, such as:\n     - TeamViewer\n     - AnyDesk\n     - Apache Guacamole\n     - Remmina\n     - VNC Connect\n\n2. **Download and Install the Software:**\n   - Download the RDP software of your choice from its official website.\n   - Install the software on both the host computer (the computer you want to access remotely) and the client computer (the computer you will use to access the host computer).\n\n3. **Configure the Host Computer:**\n   - On the host computer, enable remote access. The steps may vary depending on your operating system. Generally, you can find the remote access settings in the system preferences or control panel.\n   - Create a user account on the host computer that the client computer will use to connect.\n\n4. **Connect to the Host Computer:**\n   - On the client computer, open the RDP software and enter the IP address or hostname of the host computer.\n   - Enter the username and password of the user account you created on the host computer.\n   - Click \"Connect\" to establish the RDP connection.\n\n5. **Control the Host Computer:**\n   - Once connected, you will be able to control the host computer remotely as if you were sitting in front of it.\n   - You can open programs, access files, and perform various tasks on the host computer.\n\nRemember that to use RDP for free, both the host and client computers must be connected to the internet. Additionally, some free RDP software may have usage limitations or advertisements."}]}]
